# Critical Slowing Down in Free Recall

This repository contains all data, code, and documentation associated with the study **"Critical Slowing Down in Free Recall"**, which investigates early-warning signals in cognitive dynamics during memory retrieval. This work explores whether slowing behavior and variability in recall sequences can be quantitatively modeled as precursors to system transitions in memory performance.
